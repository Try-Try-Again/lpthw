.strip() --> Returns a copy of the string with the leading and trailing characters removed.
.encode() --> returns encoded version of a string
.decode() --> decodes the string using codec registered for encoding
if var: --> conditional
encoding= flag that determines how to interpret a file

what nmemonic should you remember for handling string encoding? DBES (dee bess)"decode bytes encode strings" 

what do you do when you have bytes and need a string? Decode Bytes

what do you do when you have a string and need bytes? Encode Strings

Whats the first step to debugging a function?
print(">>>> {{  function_name  }}") at beginning of function and print("<<<< exit {{  fuction_name  }}") at the end.
Follow the same convention for each instruction in the function

When you do a lot of debug printing, what should be different about each string you print? change up the '>>>>' '<<<<' to tell them apart.

How big should your test case be when debugging? only as large as neccesarry

experiment with debugging the functions

google repr
